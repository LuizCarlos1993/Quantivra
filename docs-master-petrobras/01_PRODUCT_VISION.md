## Primary Authority
The Figma mockup is the single source of truth for:
- Layout
- Navigation
- Screen names
- Component structure
- User flows
- Interaction behavior

No deviation is allowed.

Build a production-grade enterprise web platform that:

- Manages air quality monitoring stations
- Stores raw and validated data separately
- Allows data validation (individual and batch)
- Provides dashboards and analytics
- Supports CSV export
- Implements strict RBAC
- Complies with Petrobras cloud and security requirements

## Strategic Constraints

- Pixel-perfect UI reproduction
- Enterprise security level
- Clean architecture
- Modular backend
- Brazilian cloud region

All behaviors must match the mockup.

No features beyond what appears in the UI.
